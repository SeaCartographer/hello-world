# hello-world
First repository (Introductory)

Hello! I'm a novice, but excited to enter into the world of creative coding. I've painted with oils for years, and have reached a plateau with the medium, as far as my own enjoyment goes. I am interested in all that is made accessible to the artist in the realm of generative art, specifically machine learning and the use of neural networks. I'll arrive at that level, one day!
